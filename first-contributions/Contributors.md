## Steps to add yourself to the contributers list!

1. Head [here](https://github.com/GDSC-AdtU/Intro-to-github) and click on the `fork` button.

2. On the next page you will see a `create fork` button, press it.

3. You will land on your forked repo page, here you will see a `<> Code` button marked in green, click on it and copy the url.

4. Open your terminal and type git clone <url you copied> and press enter.

5. Now you will see a folder named `Welcome-to-Open-Source`, open it and edit the `README.md` file using any text editor, VScode for example.

6. Below is a code snippet for reference as to what has to ADDED in the file. Inside the `<b> </b>` tag you have to put your name, in the `<href >` tag, you have to place your github profile URL. And lastly you have to place your github profile photo url inside the `src` tag.

   ```

           <img src="'https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/git-status.png'" width="100px;" alt=""/>
           <br />
           <sub><b>'Raktim Borpatragohain'
       </a>
   </td>
   ```

7. Now save your changes and exit the editor, type `git add .`, afterwards `git commit -m "<your name> "` and lastly `git push origin master`.

8. Go to your forked repo page, `sync` your fork and then there you will see a button in green which says `Open pull request`, press it and in the comments section type "Adding my name to contributer list" and press on `create pull request`.

9. You have created a pull request, wait for a member to review and merge it : )
